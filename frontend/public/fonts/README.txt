Place Inter font files here:
- Inter-Variable.woff2 (preferred)
- Inter-Regular.woff2 (fallback)

If you have licensing constraints, you can download Inter (OFL license) safely from https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases and copy the .woff2 files into this folder.

This folder is served statically by Vite at /fonts/... so the @font-face URLs in App.css will resolve.
